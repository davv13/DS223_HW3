## Survival Analysis


### This assignment involves an analysis of customer retention and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on a dataset containing various subscriber attributes. The overall goal is to understand the factors influencing churn risk, interpret model coefficients, identify valuable customer segments, estimate CLV, and provide retention recommendations. 

### Dataset Overview: I will explore and understand the dataset containing subscriber information, including demographics, usage behavior, and customer category.

### Parametric Models: I will build Accelerated Time-to-Event (AFT) models with different distributions and compare them.

### CLV Calculation:I will selected the best AFT model to calculate CLV per customer.

### In the Report.ipynb, you will find all the analysis, findings and my retention recommendations.
